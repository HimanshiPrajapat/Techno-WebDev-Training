HTML
Hyper text markup language
is a code that is used to structure a web page and its content.
the components used to design the structure of websites are called HTML tags.
<!--<meta charset="UTF-8">  = Purpose: This tag specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.
Significance: By declaring charset="UTF-8", you ensure that the browser correctly interprets the character set used in the document. UTF-8 is a widely used encoding that supports almost all characters and symbols in use today, including those from various languages. This helps prevent character display issues, especially when the content includes special characters or non-Latin alphabets.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"-->  =Purpose: This tag sets the viewport settings for responsive web design.
Significance: The viewport meta tag controls the layout on mobile browsers. By setting width=device-width, you ensure that the viewport width matches the device's width, which helps your web page display correctly on different screen sizes. The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser. This is crucial for ensuring that the webpage
is readable and usable on mobile devices, as it prevents the page from being zoomed out too far or too close when first displayed.
